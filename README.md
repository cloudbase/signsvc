# Simple YubiKey Authenticode code-signing service

The purpose of this project is to perform remote code-signing on a Linux host
running Docker where a USB YubiKey (or other device) containing a code-signing
certificate is attached.
This way other hosts (e.g. Jenkins agent nodes) can send a file to be signed
to this service, receiving a signed file as a response, without the need of
having physical access to the YubiKey.

## Build the signsvc service

```console
go build
```

## Build the Docker container image

Create the *.env* file containing the variables related to your setup:

```console
USERNAME=user
PASSWORD=secret
PIN="12345678"
CERT="certificate.cer"
TS_URL="http://timestamp.digicert.com"
```

Generate a self-signed certificate or replace *cert.pem* and *key.pem* with a
certificate and its private key generated by a CA:

```console
mkdir -p cert
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cert/key.pem \
-out cert/cert.pem -days 3650 -nodes
```

Build the Docker image:

```console
docker build -t signsvc -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Run the Docker container

```console
docker run -d \
  --device /dev/bus/usb \
  -p 9115:443 \
  --name signsvc signsvc
```

## Send a signature request

The following *curl* command will send a binary file with a POST API request,
receiving the signed file in the response.

```console
curl -sSL -F file=@file.msi -u user:secret https://remote_addr:9115/sign \
-o file_signed.msi --cacert cert/cert.pem --fail
```
